Each cell has a unique address made up of its column letter and row number. For example, the first cell is <span class=\"cell-ref\">A1</span>, the cell below it is <span class=\"cell-ref\">A2</span>, and the cell to its right is <span class=\"cell-ref\">B1</span>.</p><div class=\"image-frame\"><img src=\"https://i.imgur.com/d7NzrXe.png\" alt=\"Excel cell reference example\" /></div><h3>Navigating and Selecting Cells</h3><p>There are several ways to select cells in Excel:</p><ul><li><strong>Arrow Keys:</strong> Use the keyboard arrow keys to move between cells one at a time.</li><li><strong>Direct Navigation:</strong> Type a cell reference in the Name Box (top-left corner) and press <span class=\"key function\">Enter</span> to jump to that cell.</li><li><strong>Mouse Selection:</strong> Click any cell to select it, or click and drag to select multiple cells.</li><li><strong><span class=\"key function\">Shift</span> + Click:</strong> Click a starting cell, hold <span class=\"key function\">Shift</span>, then click an end cell to select all cells between them.</li></ul><h3>Working with Cell Ranges</h3><p>A <span class=\"term\" id=\"range\">range</span> refers to a group of selected cells. When writing a range, use a colon (<span class=\"key operator\">:</span>) between two cell references to include all cells between them. For example, <span class=\"cell-ref\">A1:B1</span> includes cells <span class=\"cell-ref\">A1</span> and <span class=\"cell-ref\">B1</span>, while <span class=\"cell-ref\">A1:A5</span> includes cells <span class=\"cell-ref\">A1</span> through <span class=\"cell-ref\">A5</span>.</p><div class=\"video-container\"><video autoplay loop muted playsinline><source src=\"https://i.imgur.com/v6MgElJ.mp4\" type=\"video/mp4\">Your browser does not support the video tag.</video></div>",
